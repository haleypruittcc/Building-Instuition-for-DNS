- Connect/log into DC-1 as your domain admin account you create eariler (mydomain.com\haley_admin) 
- Connect/log into CLient-1 as a admin (mydomain\haley_admin).
- From Client-1 try ping "mainframe" notice that it fails.
- Nslookup "mainframe" notice that it fails (no DNS record)
- Create a DNS A- record on DC-1 for "mainframe" and have it point to DC-1's Private IP address
   - Service Manager -> DNS by Tools -> Forward -> on mydomain.com right click -> Lookup New Host -> mainframe and IP address.
     
- Go back to Clinet-1 and try to ping it. Observe that it works.

- Go back to DC-1 and change mainframe's record address to 8.8.8.8
- Go back to Client -1 and ping "mainframe" again. 
   - Observe that it still ping the old address.
   - Type and observe the local dns cache (ipconfig/displaydns).
- Flush the DNS cache (ipconfig/flushdns).
   - Observe that the cache is empty.
- Attempt to ping "mainframe" again.
   - Observe the address of the new record is showing up.

<h3>Step 3:CNAME Record Exercrise  </h3>

- Go back to DC-1 and create a CNAME record that points the host "search" to "www.google.com".
- Go back to Client-1 and attempt to ping "search"
    - Observe the results of the CNAME record.
    - On Client-1, nslookup "search" observe the results of the CNAME record.
